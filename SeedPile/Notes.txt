Might need to add entire {} sections to successfully update sections of code 
Only replacing certain values seems to work in some cases, but not fully
Modifying section of preexisting overrides entirely, so nothing can be left out unless we want to remove
But why?
Seems to be able to just tack on for profession in Apiary
Unsure if it needs to be like how it currently is
I wanna send a message to HushedAssassin - he created a debug menu mod, but Banished website is bullying me
If enable gatherer harvesting, disables harvesting from crop field
When gather plant with seed, enable seed, once planted crop field, disable seed. (would need to write actual code for this one)
Poor practice to "edit" source code?
Make Bani's default job include gatherer?
